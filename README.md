# Rise-of-Transformers Hackathon

## Introduction

This is the repository dedicated to the hackathon of the Advanced Topic in Deep Learning - The Rise of Transformers PhD course, held at Politecnico di Milano on 01/02/23.

The model produced during the hackathon will be refined during the semester and paired with a report containing the model's characteristics, its performance results and insights into the development process.

## Task

The main task of the hackathon is to implement a CLIP model which embeds a
set of images and corresponding captions (text descriptions of the images) into the same
embedding space using a simplified version of the ROCO dataset.

A complete task description can be viewed [here](Hackathon%20Task%20Description.pdf).
